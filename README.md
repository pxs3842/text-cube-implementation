Implementation and Performance Evaluation of Text Cube using Ontology

ABSTRACT

In the past decade, there has been a tremendous increase in the amount of data generated every day. Due to this huge influx of raw data, it is difficult to provide a comprehensible design that is highly beneficial for data storage, analysis, and prediction. Constructing relational databases for structured data has been a methodical process with satisfactory outcomes. However, the same concepts cannot be directly applied to store unstructured, textual data. Text data requires pre-processing before it can be easily stored in a columnar fashion in a relational database. Once formulated, the RDBMS is helpful in constructing cubes with text data in atomic form. However, this approach is not very helpful in representing hierarchically structured data. In this paper, a way of implementing ontologies of hierarchies in the formation of an text cube is proposed along with its performance evaluation.
